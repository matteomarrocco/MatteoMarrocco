## 💼 **Work Experience**

### 🚀 **European Space Agency (ESA)**
**Internship - Data Scientist in the Market Intelligence Team**

**March 2025 - Sept 2025**

- Developed a fully automated system that uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to identify key themes, detect relevant entities and stakeholders, track their sentiment and opinions, achieving more accurate results compared to traditional topic modeling and sentiment analysis approaches.

- Built an **automated pipeline** that processes both audio and text data, generating tailored summaries for different target audiences and answering user questions using a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach.
- Architecting an automated news intelligence system for the space domain, detecting news via **APIs**, classifying articles into categories, extracting insights with LLMs, and mapping relationships between technologies, companies, and projects using knowledge graphs.
- **Impact:** Designed and implemented fully automated, modular pipelines orchestrating workflows. Delivered valuable insights that are actively informing the team’s strategies.

## 📚 **Projects**    

### 🔍 **Regional Health Monitoring**
📅 **Sep 2024 - Feb 2025**

 - Collaborated with CBS and Maastricht University on a research project aimed at developing a regional health
 monitoring model to **assess health trends** across various municipalities.
 - Applied **generalized mixed models** and **machine learning algorithms** to uncover the most influential health
 determinants, with a case study focused on smoking behavior identifying municipalities at greater risk.
 - Addressed privacy concerns by showcasing an example of **Federated Learning**, proving its potential for secure
 data analysis.
 - **Impact:** Identified municipalities most at risk, providing insights for health interventions, even in areas with
 limited data availability.

### 🔬 **Predicting Characteristics of Polymers Using LLMs**  
📅 **Feb 2024 - July 2024**  
I fine-tuned **NVIDIA’s MegaMolBART model** to predict important molecular characteristics like **aqueous solubility** and **odor descriptors** for polymer molecules.  
- Used embeddings for **binary and multi-class classification** to analyze molecular odor descriptors.  
- Conducted **data preprocessing** and regression analysis, improving solubility prediction by **6%** with data augmentation techniques.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, MegaMolBART, PyTorch, Pandas

### 📚 **Text Mining and NLP on "Murder on the Orient Express"** 

[Project Repo](https://github.com/matteomarrocco/text-mining-and-natural-language-processing)

📅 **Apr 2024 - July 2024**  
I applied **Natural Language Processing** techniques to extract insights from the classic novel *Murder on the Orient Express*.  
- Conducted **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, **sentiment analysis**, and **emotion analysis** to uncover key themes and character relationships.  
- Used **topic modeling** and **co-occurrence analysis** to explore the story’s dynamics.  
- Built a **knowledge graph** to visualize the connections between the characters and themes.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, NLTK, NetworkX, BERT, BERTopic

### ⚽ **Football Performance Analysis Through Knowledge Graph Construction** 

[Project Repo](https://github.com/matteomarrocco/PROJECTS)

📅 **Feb 2024 - Apr 2024**  
Created a **football knowledge graph** using match statistics and player performance data to evaluate key performance indicators.  
- Analyzed top players per match based on metrics like **progressive carries**, **passes**, **shots**, and **dribbles**.  
- Focused on identifying **Under-21 players** who contributed significantly to scoring.  
- Leveraged **SPARQL** queries to gain deeper insights.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python (NetworkX, Pandas), SPARQL

### 📊 **Football and Statistics – Bachelor Thesis**  
**Mar 2023 - June 2023**  
For my Bachelor's thesis, I conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis of **Serie A 2021/2022 football data**.  
- Explored **Expected Goals (xG)** metrics and their impact on modern football analysis.  
- Investigated the **“home advantage”** factor and found no statistically significant effect.  
- Achieved a **Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.977** for match outcome predictions.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, R
